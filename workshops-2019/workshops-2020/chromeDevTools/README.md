## Requirements

Each Workshop may have differing requirements. All workshops will attempt to have a s little install needed as possible. s a general rule. Unless the workshop is on a subject requiring install.

### Use

In this workshop we will use the free online service [Glitch]((https://glitch.com/))

This is a FREE service and will run store and run HTML, CSS, JS for you. It also has the option to remix a glitch someone else has created. It is this functionality we will use for this workshop.

### Getting Started

First thing we will need is to set up the environment so everyone is starting from the same place.

We recommend being logged into Github.

If you don't have a GitHub account they are free and you can get one here:

We will then head to Glitch.

Please sign into glitch https://glitch.com/signin

GitHub sign in is recommended.

Now to the prepared pages for this workshop. Link below:

[Chrome Dev Tools Intro Page](https://eug-web-devs-dev-tools.glitch.me/)

Click on the fish in the upper right to start a remix.

A remix is your own copy of this page. You can edit the source code and glitch will auto save and serve this page for you.

Once your remix is ready your environment is ready.

The url to your remix is public and if you need any help you can post the link. Anyone can then view the page and see your code.

### Issues

There are several issues with this page.

We will use Chrome dev tools to find the issues and causes. Then change code to resolve them.

JavaScript will be run every page load to look for the expected corrections.

For these tests to be accurate please follow the instructions closely.
