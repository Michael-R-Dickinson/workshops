# Eugene Web Devs: Workshops 2019

## About

These workshops aim at bringing new aspects of web development to the foreground. While traditional databases and user interfaces are a long time staple of the web, new solutions that emerged recently became very useful tools for web developers.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) are pushing the boundaries of web development with scalable services which require very little setup and maintenance. Additionally, the rise of voice-user interfaces is yet another facet of the web experience.

Our goal with these workshops is to expose these technologies to web developers that might have yet to dive into this new chapter of the web.

The content of these workshops is entry level. There will be members of the Eugene Web Devs community on hand to help out with questions. Code samples will be provided.

Attendance to the workshops is free. Any use of AWS will be within the free tier so that participants will be able to use these services at no cost.

## Schedule

So far, two workshops are planned.
1. [Set up your own microservice with Lambda and API Gateway](./microservice)
2. [Create your first Alexa skill](./alexa)

See the folders in this repo for more docs on each workshop.
