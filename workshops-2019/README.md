# Eugene Web Devs Workshops 2019

## About

These workshops are aimed at bringing new aspects of web development. While databzses and user interface have been a long time staple of web development, new technologies are emerging as relevent to todays web development tool box. Amazon Web Services are pushing the boundries of web devlopment with services targeting scalablke use with little operations setup or matainace. Additionally the rise of a voice interface is yet another facet of the web experiance.

The goal of the workshops is to expose these technologies to web developers that might have yet to dive into this new chapter of the web.

These are entery level workshops. All code will be provided and there will be members of the Eugene Web Dvs community on hand to help out with questions.
