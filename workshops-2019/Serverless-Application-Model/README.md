# AWS SAM

## About

AWS [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) (AWS SAM) is how we can develop for AWS serverless in a local envirnemt. We can then push to AWS services like lambda.

A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks.

There are two ways to set this up.

1. On you local machine
2. In AWS cloud using and EC2 instance running Cloud9

## Use in AWS cloud

You can runs SAM in a [EC2 instence on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). EC2 is a cloud server. For a serverless microservice we can use the t2 micro instance. the t2 instence is the smallest instance avaiable. This help avid any cost as we are just testing in this workshop.
