# Lambda in Node

## About

This lambda is written using the AWS native node support. 

Node version 8.10

## Use

Simply copy and paste the example code into the lambda editor.

To install packages via npm, the AWS online local envirnment and editor [cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9) is available. This is a seperate AWS for testing lambdas in a local [SAMS](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) environment via a EC2 instance (free tier available when used in the first 12 months of creating an AWS account). Open a terminal tab in the online editor and use your package manager as normal. You can then deploy back to your production lambdas.

Alternatively, you can install SAMS and the AWS CLI on your local machine. Then upload back to AWS.
