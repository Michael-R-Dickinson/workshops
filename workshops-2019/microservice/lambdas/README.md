# Lambda

## About

This directory has several lambda examples in serveral differing languages.
Some are native to aws and others use aws layers for a custom runtime 🏃⏰.

## Use

For most of the code examples you can just copy and paste into the online aws lambda editor.
Others need to be zipped then uploaded ⬆️

See each language specific README for instructions 📄

## Dependancies

None of the examples use any packages or libraries outside the runtime.

If you would like to use a package manager like npm, pip you can use aws [cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/). This will spin up a EC2 instance with :shipit:[SAMS](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) installed. You can then install what you like, test and depoly back to your lambdas.
