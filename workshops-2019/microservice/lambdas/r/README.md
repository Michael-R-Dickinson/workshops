# Lambda in R

## About

This lambda uses a custom runtime via a lambda layer.

R version 3.5.1

## Custom Runtime Layes

Lambda layers all custom runtimes to be used. In this example we are adding R.

You can download the custom runtime here: https://github.com/bakdata/aws-lambda-r-runtime

Alternatively, you can install [SAMS](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) and the AWS CLI on your local machine. Then upload back to AWS.
