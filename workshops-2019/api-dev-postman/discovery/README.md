# API Discovery

## About

AI discovery is about finding resources for your projects and being confident the data you need is available before you code.

## Discovery Features

API dicovery can be simplified with postman collections. Importing a collection created by an API provider or create yur own to keep track of the endpoints you need. Then share with your team or even post on github for anyone to find.

If you are looking for others to consume your API removing as many barriers is key.
Postman does a lot of this for you.

* Documentation - Postman will document your APi collection. (supports markdown)
* Online Presence - Postman will host your docs and even has a API search to help others find your docs.
* API Request Examples -  In collections requests are ready to go. Auth can be set up and all the endpoints are there. Code examples can be generated by postman and even ship tests to consumers.

Many of these features are the same as the discovery fetures as Distriution and Discovery are two sides of the same coin.
