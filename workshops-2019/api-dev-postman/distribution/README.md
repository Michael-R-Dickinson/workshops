# API Distribution

## About

API distribution is all about letting developers know all about your API before they write any code.

## Distibution Features

Post wants you to distribute your API. By providing a standard via the tool itself yiou an be confident in the user experiance as we are all using the same tool. Many of these features are the same as the discovery fetures as Distriution and Discovery are two sides of the same coin.

* Documentation - Postman will document your API collection. (supports markdown)
* Online Presence - Postman will host your docs and even has a API search to help others find your docs.
* API Request Examples -  In collections requests are ready to go. Auth can be set up and all the endpoints are there. Code examples can be generated by postman and even ship tests to consumers.

## Ways to Distribute

Postman helps promote your API. By providding a place to host your docs and links to import your collections postman is cutting down the time developers spemnd gathering reqources and this will get them to first line of code faster. Once of the other things about this kind of distribution is that any developer that uses postman will instantly be confident in the discovery process becaue of a shared tool.

Because a collection definitrion is  a json document, we can even spread the word via open source. Github, Gitlab, bitbucket are all good places for developers to find your API and readmes. Even add to the collections and tests!
