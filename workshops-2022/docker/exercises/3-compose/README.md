# Exercise 3 - Docker Compose

## About

No that we have a few images created we can now create a docker-compose file to run them. üêô 

This file is a YAML file that defines the composition of our application.

If you use the Linux operating system, Install Docker Compose. https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

In this directory run the following command 

`docker compse up`

This will start the services.

You can acccess them just like before.

At:
`localhost:8080/hello`
and
`localhost`

control + c to stop the services.

To remove the containers

`docker sompose down`
