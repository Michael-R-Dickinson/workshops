# Database

## About

A very common use case for docker is running a database in a container.

Run

`docker compose up`

This will pull the mysql image and start a container.

Check to see this container running.

If you have node installed you can `npm i` and run the app.

If you do not have node installed, containerize the app and run it, then connect to the db container!
